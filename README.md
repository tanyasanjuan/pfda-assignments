# pfda-assignments
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with the solutions for the Programming for Data Analytics assignments' module.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each assignment is organized in its own directory, taking into account the week of the course in which the assignment was studied and requested. 
The directories are named according to the week that the task was required (e.g., week01, week02,...week08).

Within each directory, you could find:
◽ A Python file with the code solution. (If the task required so)
◽ Jupyter notebooks
◽ All relevant explanations and task details written as comments within the markdowns or comments in the code itself.
◽ CSV format files as part of the analysis of each task.

This approach aims to help keep the repository clean and focused on the task.

## 📑 About the Assignments
The assignements are designed to:

◽ Test the knowledge acquired in each lesson and lab.

◽ Encourage independent problem-solving.

◽ Require external research to find and apply appropriate solutions.

## 💬 Comments & Documentation
All Jupyter Notebooks and Python files are commented to:

◽ Explain the problem being solved.

◽ Describes the logic behind the code.

◽ Provide references and sources where necessary and applicable.

## 📚 Research & References
◽ Throughout the assignements, research and external resources have been cited.

◽ This information has been added to support learning and demonstrate my understanding.

◽ These references can be found in the code comments, markdowns or in links from reliable sources, such as:

- Python Docs
- W3Schools
- Pandas Docs
- Matploptlib Guide

## ✅ Repository Submission
◽ This repository helps to demonstrate my understanding and progression with each assignments.

◽ This repository (pfda-assignements) includes:
